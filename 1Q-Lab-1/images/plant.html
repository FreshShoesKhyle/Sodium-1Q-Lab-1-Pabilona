    <div> The species grow 1 to 12 metres (3 to 39 ft) tall, scrambling over other plants with their spiky thorns. 
    They are evergreen where rainfall occurs all year, or deciduous if there is a dry season. The leaves are 
    alternate, simple ovate-acuminate, 4 to 13 cm (1.6 to 5.1 in) long and 2 to 6 cm (0.79 to 2.4 in) broad. The actual 
    flower of the plant is small and generally white, but each cluster of three flowers is surrounded by three 
    or six bracts with the bright colours associated with the plant, including pink, magenta, purple, red, 
    orange, white, or yellow. Bougainvillea glabra is sometimes called "paper flower" because its bracts are 
    thin and papery. The fruit is a narrow five-lobed achene. </div>
